# OctoAcme Project Management — Quick Start

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This guide provides a high-level overview of how we run projects, covering our principles, lifecycle stages, roles, and key artifacts.

## Our Approach

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach to project delivery. We prioritize:

- **Customer value** — focus on usability and solving real problems
- **Iterative delivery** — ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership** — every project has defined leaders and accountability
- **Data-informed decisions** — measure outcomes and adapt based on evidence
- **Psychological safety** — create an environment where feedback and learning thrive

## Project Lifecycle

All OctoAcme projects follow a consistent lifecycle with five core stages:

### 1. Initiation
Validate the business need and set up the project for success.
- Define the problem statement and success metrics
- Identify stakeholders and champions
- Create a lightweight Project One-pager
- Assess initial risks and resource needs
- Make the go/no-go decision

**Key deliverable:** Project One-pager

### 2. Planning
Turn the approved initiative into an actionable plan.
- Break work into shippable increments with acceptance criteria
- Estimate scope and effort
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Create release plan and milestone map
- Define Definition of Done (DoD)

**Key deliverables:** Prioritized backlog, release plan, risk register

### 3. Execution
Build, test, and iterate on the solution.
- Follow daily standups and weekly delivery syncs
- Use project boards to track progress (Backlog → In Progress → Done)
- Submit small PRs with tests and clear acceptance criteria
- Conduct regular demos and reviews
- Escalate blockers and update risk register

**Key activities:** Development, testing, code reviews, continuous integration

### 4. Release
Deploy features to production with confidence.
- Validate all acceptance criteria are met
- Run smoke tests in staging
- Execute deployment and post-deploy verification
- Communicate release to stakeholders
- Monitor for issues and be ready to rollback if needed

**Key deliverables:** Release notes, deployment checklist, smoke test results

### 5. Retrospective
Capture learnings and drive continuous improvement.
- Reflect on what went well and what could improve
- Define 2–3 actionable improvements with owners
- Track and follow up on action items
- Celebrate wins and share knowledge across teams

**Key deliverable:** Retrospective notes with action items

## Roles & Personas

OctoAcme projects involve collaboration across several key roles:

- **Project Manager (PM)** — Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)** — Defines what to build, prioritizes the backlog, measures success
- **Developers** — Implement features, write tests, participate in design and code reviews
- **QA/Testing** — Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders** — Provide input, approvals, and business context

For detailed responsibilities and communication patterns, see [octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, we maintain these essential documents:

- **Project Charter / One-pager** — Problem, goals, success metrics, timeline
- **Roadmap and Release Plan** — Milestones and delivery schedule
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog** — Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done** — Quality standards and completion criteria
- **Risk Register** — Identified risks, impact, mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes** — Learnings and action items for improvement

## Communication Cadence

Regular communication keeps projects aligned and moving forward:

- **Daily standups** — Quick sync on progress, blockers, and dependencies (15 min)
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync** — Alignment on priorities and decisions
- **Twice-weekly team standups** — Delivery team coordination
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** — High-level progress and upcoming milestones
- **Sprint demos** — Show completed work and gather feedback

## Risk Management

We proactively identify and manage risks throughout the project:

- Maintain a Risk Register with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation
- Review risks weekly in delivery syncs
- Escalate blockers through defined paths: Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- Communicate transparently with stakeholders about challenges

For details, see [octoacme-risks-and-communication.md](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md).

## Getting Started

New to an OctoAcme project? Here's what to do:

1. **Read the Project One-pager** — Understand the problem, goals, and success metrics
2. **Review the backlog** — Familiarize yourself with planned work and priorities
3. **Check the Definition of Done** — Know what "complete" means for this project
4. **Join standups and syncs** — Stay connected with the team rhythm
5. **Ask questions** — We value psychological safety and collaborative learning
